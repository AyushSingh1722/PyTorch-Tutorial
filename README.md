# PyTorch-Tutorial

First, you can brush up on your Python programming to better understand PyTorch: [Intermediate Python Programming](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/).

Official PyTorch Documentations : [Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) and [Learn the Basics
](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html#learn-the-basics).

PyTorch Tutorials that go deeper than just the basics: [Aladdin Persson's YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhyoLH6IjfxeoooqP9rhU3HJIAVAJ3Vz) and [Aladdin Persson's GitHub Codes](https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/master/ML/Pytorch).

A free course designed for people with some coding experience who want to learn how to apply deep learning and machine learning to practical problems: [Jeremy Howard's Practical Deep Learning Course](https://course.fast.ai/).
